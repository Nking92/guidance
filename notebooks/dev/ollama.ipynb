      "Rayleigh scattering is a process that occurs when light travels through a medium, such as air or water, and interacts with the small particles that are present in the medium, such as molecules or dust particles.

The smaller the particles, the more they are scattered, so the blue color of the sky is most pronounced when the sun is overhead and the air is calm.\n",
